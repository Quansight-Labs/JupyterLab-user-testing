## Overview üìù

The environment is based on [The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)][TLJH] which is a JupyterHub distribution for a few users (0-100).

For more information about The Littlest JupyterHub, [refer to TLJH's official documentation][TLJH].

The contents of this repository are:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github                   # GitHub Actions workflows used to deploy the environment through Terraform
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks                 # Notebooks used for user testing (contain the tasks or workflows to be tested)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .pre-commit-config.yaml   # Configuration file for pre-commit hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies needed for the testing workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec-file.txt             # Text file with all the Python dependencies  needed for the testing workflows as well as their subdependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf                   # Terraform configuration file
```

The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file includes the libraries installed in TLJH and their corresponding versions. The [spec-file.txt](./spec-file.txt) includes the libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file as well as their dependencies (and their versions). It also includes the JupyterHub and JupyterLab versions installed through the TLJH deployment.

## Development and deployment üèó

This section provides information on how to make changes to and deploy the user testing environment.

### Pre-requisites

To use the contents of this repository _as is_ you will need to have the following tools installed:

- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) >= 1.3.7

> **Note**:
> You can deploy TLJH on any public cloud provider. We have so far used GCP as our provider of choice, but TLJH in itself is vendor-agnostic.
> Refer to the [TLJH documentation for more details][TLJH] on how to deploy TLJH on other cloud providers.

Optional requirements - but needed if intending to use the repository contents as-is:

- A Google Cloud Platform user account
- A Cloudflare user account

> **Warning**:
> While the GitHub actions workflows in this repository gets credentials via OIDC (OpenID Connect) you can use a different method to get credentials.

For more information on getting GCP credentials, refer to these documentation links:

- [How to get credentials for GCP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started)
- [How to get credentials for Cloudflare](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs)

### Deployment

There are three major steps to deploying the testing environment:

1. Provisioning the virtual machine (VM) on which TLJH will be installed
2. Installing TLJH on your VM
3. Adding any necessary customizations

‚òÅÔ∏è Currently, all infrastructure is deployed via Terraform to GCP. To get more details about the resources created as well as the values for `variables.tf`, refer to the [Terraform configuration](#terraform-configuration-) section below.

The GitHub actions workflow [`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) workflow automatically handles the provisioning, installation, and customization steps mentioned above.

- **When a new Pull Request is opened:** the `terraform plan` step is run
  which checks what resources will be created/destroyed/or updated. And a comment is added to the PR with the corresponding plan.
  ![GitHub PR comment with the Terraform plan](./img/pr-comment.png)
- **On push/merge to `main`:** resources are applied via `terraform apply` and the cloud resources will be created/destroyed/updated accordingly.

To provision the VM (on your infrastructure) you will need to follow these steps:

1. For this repository and clone to your local machine.
2. Update the variables in [`variables.tf`](./variables.tf) to match your requirements.
3. Commit your changes and open a Pull Request against your fork of the repository.
4. This will trigger the `terraform plan` step in the GitHub Actions workflow.
5. If all seems to work correctly you can merge the Pull Request to `main`, which will trigger the provisioning step in the GitHub actions workflow.
6. Once the deployment and customization are completed, you can immediately log in to the `http://<your-domain>` with the `<admin-user-name>` specified in `variables.tf` and set an initial password.

   > **Warning:**
   > Make sure to read the [Security considerations and suggestions in the TLJH documentation](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/topic/security.html) before proceeding.
   > In brief: make sure only the GCP resources admin has `sudo` access to the VM and grant the least-privilege access to users and testers.

### Teardown

If you would like to destroy the cluster or turn it off temporarily
there is a Terraform setting `enabled` which should be switched to a
value of `false`. When you would like it re-enabled change the
value back to true. Keep in mind that this deployment is stateless.
