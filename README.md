## Overview üìù

The environment is based on [The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)][TLJH] which is a JupyterHub distribution for a few users (0-100).

For more information about The Littlest JupyterHub, [refer to TLJH's official documentation][TLJH].

The contents of this repository are:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github - GitHub Actions workflows used to deploy the environment through Terraform
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks - Notebooks used for user testing (contain the tasks or workflows to be tested)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Configuration file for pre-commit
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `main.tf` - Terraform configuration file
```

## Development and deployment üèó

This section provides information on how to make changes to and deploy the user testing environment.

### Pre-requisites

To use the contents of this repository as is you will need to have the following tools installed:

- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

> **Note**:
> You can deploy TLJH on any public cloud provider. We have so far used GCP as our provider of choice, but TLJH in itself is vendor-agnostic.
> Refer to the [TLJH documentation for more details][TLJH].

Optional requirements - but needed if intending to use the repository contents as-is:

- A Google Cloud Platform account
- A Cloudflare account

> **Warning**:
> While the GitHub actions workflows in this repository gets credentials via OIDC (OpenID Connect) you can use a different method to get credentials.

For more information on getting GCP credentials, refer to:

- [How to get credentials for GCP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started)
- [How to get credentials for Cloudflare](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs)

### Deployment

There are three major steps to deploying the environment:

- [JupyterLab User Testing Environment](#jupyterlab-user-testing-environment)
  - [Overview üìù](#overview-)
  - [Development and deployment üèó](#development-and-deployment-)
    - [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
    - [Deployment](#deployment)
      - [Provisioning the VM on GCP](#provisioning-the-vm-on-gcp)
      - [Installing TLJH](#installing-tljh)
      - [Setting a DNS and a custom domain](#setting-a-dns-and-a-custom-domain)

#### Provisioning the VM on GCP

Currently, all infrastructure is deployed via Terraform to GCP. The following resources are created:

- VM: `Ubuntu 22.02 LTS` of size `e2-standard-2 (2 CPU and 8 GB RAM)
- GCP region: `us-central1-a` region/zone

This deployment is handled automatically through the [`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) workflow.

- **When a new Pull Request is opened:** `terraform plan` step is run
which checks what resources will be created/destroyed/or updated. And a comment is added with the corresponding plan
- **On push/merge to `main`:** resources are applied via `terraform apply` and the cloud resources will be created/destroyed/updated accordingly.

#### Installing TLJH

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with your Google account.
2. [Connect to your instance through SSH](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/ssh)
3. Install TLJH - copy the text below and paste it into the **Startup script** text in the GCP console:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://tljh.jupyter.org/bootstrap.py \
    | sudo -E python3 - \
    --admin <admin-user-name>
   ```

   Where `<admin-user-name>` is your GCP username.

   For more details on what the installer does, refer to the [TLJH documentation: What does the installer do?](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/topic/installer-actions.html#topic-installer-actions).

#### Setting a DNS and a custom domain

```bash
   # enable HTTPS and setup an email and domain
   sudo tljh-config set https.enabled true
   sudo tljh-config set https.letsencrypt.email <your-email>
   sudo tljh-config add-item https.letsencrypt.domains <your-domain>

   # reload the proxy to apply the changes
   sudo tljh-config reload proxy

   # set the default app to JupyterLab
   sudo tljh-config set user_environment.default_app jupyterlab
   sudo tljh-config reload hub
   sudo -E conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas scipy
```

1.  login to domain with `https://<your-domain>` with username `<admin-user-name>` and set initial password
